Introduction:
Air pollution is a major environmental issue that affects the health and well-being of people around the world. The PM2.5 level, which refers to the concentration of particulate matter smaller than 2.5 micrometers, is a critical indicator of air quality and can have significant health impacts. To help address this issue, this project aims to predict PM2.5 levels for the next season using historical air quality data and LSTM models.

Dependencies:
This project requires Python 3, as well as the following libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, and TensorFlow. These can be installed using pip or another package manager.

Usage:
To use this project, you will need to provide air quality data in an Excel file with columns for Station, PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, SO2, CO, Ozone, WS, WD, SR, and AT. The Station column should contain the names of the stations for which you want to make predictions. Once you have your data, simply run the main script, which will load, clean, scale, train, and predict using LSTM models for each station. The predictions for the next season will be printed for each station.

Details:
The main script begins by loading the air quality data from the Excel file using pandas. The data is then cleaned by replacing 'None' values with NaN and dropping any rows with missing values. The data is then split into separate models for each station using the unique values in the Station column.

The relevant features for each station are selected, which include PM10, NO, NO2, NOx, SO2, CO, Ozone, WS, WD, SR, and AT. The data is then scaled using scikit-learn's MinMaxScaler to ensure that each feature is on a similar scale.

The data is then split into training and testing sets using scikit-learn's train_test_split function. The LSTM model is defined using TensorFlow's Keras API, with two LSTM layers and a dense output layer. The model is trained using the cleaned and scaled data, with the loss function set to mean squared error and the optimizer set to Adam.

Once the model is trained, it is used to predict the PM2.5 levels for the next season using the most recent 11 data points. The predictions are then printed for each station.

Conclusion:
This project provides a useful tool for predicting PM2.5 levels for the next season using historical air quality data. By providing accurate predictions, this project can help individuals and organizations take action to mitigate the health impacts of air pollution.
